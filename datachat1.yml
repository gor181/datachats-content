description: "In this episode of DataChats Nick talks with Max Kuhn, the creator of the caret package for R.
Max is a frequent speaker at many of the main data science conferences and is well known as the creator of the caret package
for R, an essential tool in every R userâ€™s machine learning toolbox.

In this 30 min conversation, Max talks about how he originally wanted to become a journalist, why he defines himself as a
statistician rather than a data scientist, his thoughts on deep learning, strategies for breaking into the field,
and much more."
